In the program provided,
the server just sends a
message string to the
client after it connects.
Modify the server so that
when the client sends a
string to the server, the
server reverses the string
before sending it back

to the client.
For example, if the client
sends HELLO to the server, the
client should receive OLLEH.
Your client program should
print the string sent by the
client and the
corresponding string received
by the client from the server.
